# SmartQA : AI-Driven Test Case Generator Integrated with Jira

## Overview
SmartQA is an AI-assisted Quality Engineering project that connects with Jira to automatically process user stories and generate structured test cases for intelligent QA workflows.

## Features
- Fetch Jira User Stories via REST API
- Extract Acceptance Criteria and other key requirements
- Parse Jira ADF format into human-readable QA requirements
- Prepare structured dataset for AI-based test case generation
- Automatically generate test cases based on user stories
- Export or attach generated test cases back to Jira

## Why This Project Matters
In real Agile teams, user stories live in Jira, but QA engineers often have to manually read each story and write test cases separately.  
This manual approach is:

- Time-consuming  
- Prone to missed scenarios  
- Leads to inconsistent test coverage  

SmartQA automates this process by fetching user stories, extracting requirements, and generating test cases using AI, saving time and improving quality.

## Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Jira REST API
- Axios
- Agile / Scrum methodologies
- Quality Engineering principles
